# Kontroller

Your HTML-based tool for playing jingles and loops. It seems to work with Chrome, Safari and Firefox, though they all add a delay when playing loops.

## Bring your own sounds


This is made for a local use : add your own WAVs in any folder, point to them 
in app.js, tune index.html or style.css to fit your style, then turn your home 
in the craziest radio ever.

Usage : click to play.
